About this site

Hi, I'm Athena and I'm a journalism student who likes data and Formula1.

I'm making a website with Formula1 racing data for a class assignment in Intro Coding for Journalists. It is due Dec. 4, 2023.

I'm using Visual Studio Code, Bootstrap and Nunjucks to make my website. But I like R and I'm using it to get the data from an API and get it ready for my website pages.

I'll put the link to my website here when I finish it.
